"""safety.py — static AST gate run on LLM-generated candidate code BEFORE exec().

This is the first layer of defence-in-depth for the GEODISC evolutionary discovery
loop. The eval worker takes an LLM-generated source string defining
``run_claim(df_train, df_eval)`` and runs it on REAL geochemical data. Before
that string is ever compiled and executed, this module confirms that it only
uses a small allowlist of import roots and does not call (or attribute-reach
into) the Python builtins / stdlib modules that touch the OS, network, process
tree, or interpreter internals.

Combined with:
  * ``resource.setrlimit`` caps applied in ``eval_worker.py`` (CPU, file size,
    fork count), and
  * the macOS ``sandbox-exec`` profile (``geo_worker.sb``) that denies network
    and restricts writes,
this gate bounds what untrusted LLM code can do even when the proposer is
adversarial or buggy.

The checker is intentionally conservative: it parses with ``ast``, so it makes
no claim to defeat truly obfuscated source, but it does catch the obvious
escape hatches (``open``, ``eval``, ``os.system``, ``subprocess.run``,
``__import__``). The sandbox + rlimit layers backstop anything subtler.

Public API: ``check_source(src, entry_point="run_claim") -> (ok, reason)``.
It NEVER raises: any internal failure returns ``(False, "check-failed: ...")`` so
the caller (the worker) can fail the candidate safely rather than crash.
