"""evolved_discovery_consumer.py — bridge evolved_analysis → GEODISC's discovery loop.

The auto-start discovery loop calls consume_evolved_discoveries(system) once per
cycle. It folds any NEW machine-verified records from
~/.geodisc_persistent/evolved_discoveries.json into the loop's in-memory store
(``system.genuine_discoveries``), shaped as GEODISC discoveries with
``validation.quality='GENUINE'`` / ``is_genuine=True`` (they ARE genuine — verified
by code execution on real data, unlike GEODISC's LLM-self-judged discoveries). The
loop's existing _save_discovery_store then persists them in the GENUINE bucket.

Design constraints (the loop has a deadlock/blocking history, CLAUDE.md v5–v7):
  - NEVER raises — every failure is logged and swallowed.
  - No locks, no blocking I/O, no network. One small file read + list append.
  - Idempotent across cycles AND service restarts: dedup by
    verification.program_hash against what is already in system.genuine_discoveries.
